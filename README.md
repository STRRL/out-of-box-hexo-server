# out-of-box-hexo-server

A web server in docker, and auto-configured ssh service.  
Just deploy your hexo blog with `hexo-deloyer-sftp` without configures.

Docker environment, so it is clean, secure and easy to use.

## TODO list

- [x] Nginx docker image with openssh.
- [x] Automatic generate ssh private key.
- [ ] Test with `hexo-deloyer-sftp`.
- [ ] Add some arguments such as private key passphrase.
